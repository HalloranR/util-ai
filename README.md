I got the setup and the curves working for utility ai. I ran out of time trying to connec the states (hungry, danger, love) to actions so the sheep dont move but they produce curves. 
The only exception is that I got the sheep to procreate if their curves have love at the top. This is very buggy but it is halarious seeing 3 baby sheep pop up out of no where. (the children immediately make children with others creating a matrix of child sheep)
I created the wolves class and I put them in the game but I havent yet copied over the structure from the sheep. (They would be very simmilar).
